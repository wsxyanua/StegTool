## STEGANOGRAPHY TOOL

A tool that allows you to hide your information in an image. 

## Features

### General
- **Modern & Responsive UI**: A redesigned interface with improved contrast and readability, ensuring a seamless experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Quick Guide**: An integrated sidebar provides a quick start guide for new users.
- **Real-time Feedback**: The application provides real-time status updates, character counts, and progress indicators.

### Hiding Messages (Encoding)
- **Versatile Image Support**: Upload a wide range of image formats, including `JPG`, `PNG`, `GIF`, `WebP`, and `SVG`.
- **Automatic Format Conversion**: The tool automatically converts unsupported input formats into a compatible format (`PNG`, `BMP`, or `TIFF`) to proceed with the steganography process.
- **Multiple Algorithms**: Choose from three different steganography methods:
    - **LSB**: Least Significant Bit - Simple, high-capacity method.
    - **DCT**: Discrete Cosine Transform - More robust and resistant to detection.
    - **DWT**: Discrete Wavelet Transform - An advanced, highly resilient algorithm.
- **Password Protection**: Secure your hidden message with an optional password for an extra layer of security.
- **Capacity Indicator**: Instantly see the maximum message size an image can hold.

### Extracting Messages (Decoding)
- **Simple Extraction Process**: Upload an image containing a hidden message.
- **Method & Password Matching**: Select the correct algorithm and enter the password (if used) to retrieve the secret data.
- **Easy Output**: Copy the extracted message to your clipboard or download it as a text file.

## Method 
I know that you won't read it but I'll still make it comprehensive:
- **LSB**: Least Significant Bit - simple but support high resolution image.
- **DCT**: Discrete Cosine Transform - more advanced and harder to decode.
- **DWT**: Discrete Wavelet Transform - most advanced algorithm by far(with my skill probably).

## USAGE

1. Open `web/index.html` in your favourite browser.
2. Choose between 2 tabs HIDE or EXTRACT.
3. Upload single image file.
4. Wait for magic to happen.
5. Click on "?" button for quick guide.



## Security (IMPORTANT)

This tool is completely offline and runs at your local machine, since that, the data will be all upload to MY server and I will use it for commercial and exploitations hehe(jk).

## DISCLAIMER (THE REPETITIVE BUT NECESSARY PART)
