# SECURITY DOCUMENTATION

## OVERVIEW (THE SERIOUS STUFF)

This steganography tool implements what we like to call "military-grade" security features (because that sounds impressive) to protect your hidden messages from prying eyes and nosy algorithms.

## ENCRYPTION IMPLEMENTATION (THE NERDY DETAILS)

### AES-256-CBC Encryption
- **Algorithm**: Advanced Encryption Standard with 256-bit keys (fancy math that makes NSA sweat)
- **Mode**: Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) for enhanced security (blocks depend on each other, like a crypto family)
- **Key Size**: 256 bits (32 bytes) - bigger than your attention span
- **Block Size**: 128 bits (16 bytes) - bite-sized encryption chunks

### Key Derivation (Password Stretching)
- **Algorithm**: PBKDF2 (Password-Based Key Derivation Function 2) - a mouthful, but it works
- **Hash Function**: SHA-256 (the reliable workhorse)
- **Iterations**: 100,000 (OWASP recommended minimum) - makes brute force attacks cry
- **Salt Size**: 256 bits (32 bytes) - randomly generated per encryption (no two alike, like snowflakes)
- **Output**: 256-bit encryption key (the secret sauce)

### Initialization Vector (IV) (The Random Starter)
- **Size**: 128 bits (16 bytes) - perfectly sized chaos
- **Generation**: Cryptographically secure random generation (not your birthday)
- **Uniqueness**: New IV for every encryption operation (because reusing is for quitters)

## Security Features

### Password Security
- **Minimum Length**: 8 characters
- **Complexity Requirements**: 3 out of 4 character types required:
  - Uppercase letters (A-Z)
  - Lowercase letters (a-z)
  - Digits (0-9)
  - Special characters (!@#$%^&*()_+-=[]{}|;:,.<>?)
- **Strength Validation**: Real-time password strength assessment

### Data Integrity
- **Padding Validation**: PKCS#7 padding with integrity checks
- **Tamper Detection**: Automatic detection of data corruption
- **Error Handling**: Secure error messages without information leakage

### Randomness
- **Source**: `secrets` module (cryptographically secure)
- **Usage**: Salt generation, IV generation
- **Quality**: Suitable for cryptographic purposes

## Security Considerations

### Strengths
- **Military-grade encryption**: AES-256 is approved for TOP SECRET data (the government trusts it, so should you)
- **Proper key derivation**: PBKDF2 prevents rainbow table attacks (sorry hackers, no shortcuts)
- **Unique ciphertext**: Same message+password produces different output (like fingerprints, but for data)
- **Forward secrecy**: Compromised session doesn't affect others (compartmentalization is key)

### Limitations
- **Steganographic detection**: Advanced analysis may detect hidden data presence (we're good, but not invisible)
- **Password dependency**: Security relies entirely on password strength (use "password123" at your own risk)
- **No perfect forward secrecy**: Same password reuse is possible (variety is the spice of life)
- **Side-channel attacks**: Not protected against timing/power analysis (we're not that paranoid... yet)

### Best Practices
1. **Use strong passwords**: Follow complexity requirements
2. **Unique passwords**: Don't reuse passwords across messages
3. **Secure storage**: Store passwords securely, never in plaintext
4. **Lossless formats**: Only use PNG, BMP, TIFF - never JPEG
5. **Secure deletion**: Overwrite original files after encoding

## Threat Model

### Protected Against
- **Brute force attacks**: PBKDF2 with 100,000 iterations
- **Dictionary attacks**: Password complexity requirements
- **Rainbow tables**: Unique salt per encryption
- **Ciphertext analysis**: AES-256-CBC with random IV

### Not Protected Against
- **Steganalysis**: Statistical analysis may detect hidden data
- **Keyloggers**: Password capture during entry
- **Memory dumps**: Passwords/keys in memory during operation
- **Social engineering**: User revealing passwords
- **Quantum computers**: Future quantum attacks on AES

## Compliance

### Standards
- **FIPS 140-2**: AES-256 algorithm compliance
- **NIST SP 800-132**: PBKDF2 implementation guidelines
- **RFC 3394**: AES key wrapping (where applicable)
- **OWASP**: Password policy recommendations

### Certifications
- **AES-256**: NSA approved for TOP SECRET data
- **SHA-256**: FIPS 180-4 compliant
- **PBKDF2**: RFC 2898 standard implementation

## Security Testing

### Automated Tests
- **Encryption/Decryption**: Roundtrip testing
- **Password validation**: Strength requirement enforcement
- **Tamper detection**: Modified ciphertext rejection
- **Error handling**: Secure failure modes

### Manual Testing
- **Steganalysis resistance**: Basic statistical tests
- **Password attacks**: Brute force simulation
- **Data corruption**: Integrity verification

## Security Updates

- **Regular updates**: Monitor for cryptographic library updates
- **Vulnerability tracking**: Subscribe to security advisories
- **Patch management**: Apply security patches promptly

**Disclaimer**: While this tool implements strong cryptographic protections, no security system is perfect. Use appropriate operational security practices and understand the limitations outlined above. Don't blame me if the NSA still finds your cat memes.
